# Pete's Portfolio Starter Project

This project involved completing a portfolio template for Pete and helped me develop skills in HTML and dive a bit deeper with CSS, as well as understanding essential design concepts.

## Technologies

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the portfolio.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with mobile-first principles in mind.
